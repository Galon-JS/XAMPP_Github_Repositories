                    <h3>Sound Quality</h3>
                    <p>Sound quality is how accurately audio is reproduced as intended by the producer/engineer. Our reference for headphones sound quality is the loudspeaker. The ideal headphone sounds like the ideal stereo speaker setup in the ideal room.</p>

                    <h3>Isolation</h3>
                    <p>Isolation describes a pair of headphones’ ability to isolate you from the outside world. This means that the headphones should be able to block ambient noise from distracting your listening experience and also prevent audio leakage, which can be disturbing to the people around you.</p>

                    <h3>Connectivity</h3>
                    <p>Connectivity describes the various ways that a pair of headphones can connect to an audio source. Headphones without connectivity don’t serve very many purposes besides noise isolation. Some sort of connection is required to transmit audio data to the headphones so they can create sound. The ideal pair of headphones would work both wired and wirelessly, supporting Bluetooth with various codecs as well as a lower-latency radio frequency (RF) signal transmitted by a customizable and adaptive base station.</p>
